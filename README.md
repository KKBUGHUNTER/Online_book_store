# Project Overview:
This project aims to build a robust online book store to handle user authentication, authorization, and access management. The key features of the project are:

 - Secure user registration and authentication
 - Account deactivation and deletion
 - Protection against vulnerabilities like SQL injection attacks
 - Proper system logging with retention policies upon system failure
 - Users can easily search and filter books and add them to a shopping cart
 - Admins have the ability to manage inventory and others
 - A simple frontend using Next.js and React.js with MaterialUI or TailwindCSS as the CSS library

## Project Plan
The following is a high-level project plan:
 - Requirements gathering and analysis: This will involve understanding the functional and non-functional requirements of the system, as well as the constraints and assumptions.
 - System design: This will involve designing the system architecture, database schema, and user interface.
 - Implementation: This will involve writing the code for the system, including the backend APIs and the frontend user interface.
 - Testing: This will involve testing the system to ensure that it meets all of the requirements and that it is free of bugs.
 - Deployment: This will involve deploying the system to a production environment.

### Functionality and Features

The following are the key functionalities and features of the online book store:

 - User registration and authentication
 - Account deactivation and deletion
 - Book search and filtering
 - Shopping cart management
 - Book purchase
 - Book reviews
 - Inventory management (Bonus)

### Data Input/Output
The following are the main data inputs and outputs of the system:
